# FoursmartAnts-final-IEproject
The purpose of this report is to provide a detailed description of this project and the various stages of implementation that are and will be involved in this project. The product that we are developing, which is discussed below in this report is related to ‘CareKids’. It is a website that aims at helping parents with kids having allergies to save all the important allergy related information and the specific needs for their kid, so that whenever their kid is attending any event, then it can be shared with the host of that event in an appropriate manner.
